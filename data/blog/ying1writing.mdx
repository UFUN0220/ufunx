把我最后看的自己准备英一作文的 8 张手稿放在本文末尾了。本文【模板与素材】中的内容基于我的手稿，是我最后一遍默写完的定稿。虽然手稿书写潦草，但完成的时间非常快，每一篇我当时都能记得非常清楚，存手机里方便随时看。

## 序：备考策略与说明

### 1. 对上篇文章的补充说明

* **资料**：考研英语资料我只买了黄皮书。只用了里面的真题和答案解析，作文书没买。**重点：英语答题卡要买**，主要是作文部分，最后默写自己模板的时候用，找手感。政治答题卡不用买，大题背就行了。
* **网课**：作文我看过 B 站晶婷的视频，不用听她讲，直接找对应的 PPT 暂停截图，效率很高。收集可能可以用到的句子，再自己改写重组。
* **真题策略**：
    * **客观题**：刷题看感觉，感觉不好再找对应题型的讲解。
    * **主观题**：翻译难度不大，翻出大概意思即可。作文我没怎么练真题，我相信背好模板考场上套就行。预测押题都不靠谱，不要在意，把自己准备的模板背好就可以了。
* **时间线**：
    * 11.1 - 11.10：刷完 15 套真题客观题。
    * 11.11 - 12.04：主攻数学专业课。
    * 12.05 - 12.06：集中准备英语作文。
    * 考前几天：模拟近三年真题，熟练背诵默写模板。

### 2. 关于“模板与素材”的定义

本文总结的句式与结构，针对于应试，具有普遍适用性，且符合我的语言习惯。
* **风格**：不追求高级华丽的用词，尽最大努力**不出错**。
* **理念**：许多模板给人感觉上限很高，但考场很难写出来。我的想法是**保下限**。
* **区分**：小作文称为“模板”（结构固定，发挥空间小）；大作文称为“素材”（积累句式，看图说话）。

### 3. 关于“重复率”的担忧

有朋友担心公开模板会和别人重复，我觉得不用担心：
1.  **限制多**：题目要求和字数限制了发挥，正确的表达方式就那几种。
2.  **容错率**：考研人数众多，绝大部分人即使准备了，考场上也写不出来或写得很粗糙。成文无语法错误且切题，已经是妥妥的高分。

### 4. 建议：博采众长

有时间最好整理自己的模板。最快的方法是多看几个博主的公开资料，挑好的句子修改整合成自己的。

## 24英一考场实战复盘

考场上和自己模拟的状态会相差很大，多做准备。

**整体感觉**：阅读难度和前两年比挺稳定的，翻译明显简单。

### 小作文：建议信

**题干**：

![24年小作文题干](/static/images/articles/kaoyan-english/2024-small-question.png)

**考场思路**：
我预测到了建议信，所以非常有把握。题干里 `advice` 确定了类型。
如果是考**通知**（如23年），难度会大一些，因为发挥空间小，格式要求严。

内容上，中国科学家我写了**祖冲之**。先描述成就，再谈影响：
* 他解决了一些数学难题，发明了不少公式原理，推动了古代中国数学的发展。
* 不仅在数学方面成果颇丰，作为古代闻名的科学家对后世亦有教育意义与深远影响。

主体段就是把上面这两句中文翻译过去。我的方法是**中文思维 -> 翻译英文**，虽然不够地道，但稳。

**参考范文**：

### 大作文：图画+图表

**题干**：

![24年大作文题干](/static/images/articles/kaoyan-english/2024-big-question.png)

**考场思路**：
刚看到题目惊了一下，因为这是**历史首次英一考了图画+图表**（以往这是英二的特征）。但细想，题干给了更多信息，反而不需要自己发散联想，降低了跑题概率。

* **图画内容**：横幅【市民健身区】，右下角说【家门口新建的小公园真不错！】
* **主体分析**：
    1.  **市民**（显性）：身体健康，精神愉悦。
    2.  **政府**（隐性）：从“新建”和图表推断，是政府做出的明智决策。
* **破题关键**：如果没讨论政府的作用，分数不会高。必须从市民需求和政府决策相辅相成的角度写。

### 大作文素材 (通用句式)

#### 素材 1：图画描述与原因分析

> Graphically depicted in the caricature is an old man lying on the sports ground, who is rejected by his sons and daughters, guarding their care of their father. The caption at the bottom indicates, "..."
>
> Without the thought-provoking drawing above, an insightful phenomenon would go unnoticed: ...
>
> Despite its simplicity, this drawing carries profound meaning. It emphasizes the significance of family care and encourages individuals to value it, which can be elucidated as follows.
>
> There are numerous reasons for this appearance. The primary contributing factor is that young people are currently facing an excessive workload and pressure in their academic and professional lives, including endless coursework and challenging projects at work. Thus, during mealtimes, they crave some personal time instead of conversing with each other. The second noteworthy reason is that social media on smartphones, from engaging video clips to immersive games, exerts a tremendous fascination on the young.
>
> As far as I am concerned, this phenomenon is exceedingly detrimental to young people's mental well-being. Provided that they dedicate more time and energy to the virtual world, the odds are that their ability to focus will be jeopardized.

#### 素材 2：社会趋势与个人发展

> As information continues to grow and technology advances, people are empowered with a constant supply of goods that foster happiness.
>
> However, the recent pandemic disrupted trade and business ties, partially reversing the abundance and prosperity, leading to an inevitable shift in mindset and daily habits.
>
> As a result, people are now more inclined to prioritize their own lives and self-actualization. Due to rapid economic globalization and urbanization, we tend to focus on individual and societal progress. However, the importance of family care should not be forgotten, as it is an essential aspect of our lives that provides emotional support, security, and a sense of belonging. Therefore, it is crucial for individuals to strike a balance between personal advancement and caring for their families.
>
> The misbehavior of these individuals can be roughly attributed to their lack of specific knowledge. However, the fundamental reason is that their morality gives in to selfishness, and they become addicted to the substantial benefits of greedy desire.
>
> In a nutshell, effective measures should be adopted to reverse the grim trend. First and foremost, it is sensible for somebody to... Furthermore, concerted efforts should be made to... Let's prepare ourselves and embrace a harmonious and disciplined society constructed through our collective efforts.

#### 素材 3：道德与价值观

> The character on the left argues, "...", while the man on the right deems that...
>
> In the sweeping trend, the decline of morality symbolizes the vanishing of certain traditional virtues, especially ..., which is undeniably shaping our lives. The trend is closely linked to the changing perspective on...
>
> All kinds of publicity, whether they are newspapers or the Internet, advocate vigorously what prevents us from suffering setbacks rather than (...), inducing people to...
>
> It is (...) that helps us reach the other shore of success. (...) is the essential component of a rosy future. (...) will equip us with rich knowledge and long-term vision —— two essential qualifications to gain success. Doing something blindly makes the young seek the glamorous appearance but fail to emphasize inner endeavor and persistence.
>
> To summarize, the concrete strategies are... In general, (...) would be a double-edged sword if (...) was used carelessly or without restrictions. The key to approaching this issue is to initiate widespread social-moral education, ensuring that individuals are truly aware of the importance of (...), thus abandoning uncivilized behaviors. Enacting well-enforced laws to curb inappropriate behavior in violation of public virtues should be the government's priority, which is imperative.
